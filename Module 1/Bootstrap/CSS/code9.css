      The annual community picnic is scheduled for July 10th at Central Park. Everyone is welcome to join for a day of games, food, and music. Local bands will be performing and there will be plenty of activities for children and adults alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volunteers are needed for setup, food service, and cleanup. If you're interested, please contact the community center. There will also be a bake sale organized by the neighborhood association, with proceeds going to park improvement projects.

      Other upcoming events include the city-wide garage sale and the outdoor movie nights starting in August. Be sure to check the community calendar for more details.
